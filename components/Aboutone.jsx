            Monopauly's inception in 2023 was driven by a single, clear goal: To
            help U.S. and other such high-cost market individuals save
            significantly on LLC formations, DBA filings, and compliance by
            leveraging the power of currency arbitrage- offering high-quality
            legal and business services at a fraction of domestic costs.

            Our clients benefit from the cost advantages of the global economy,
            including favourable forex rates, efficient processes, and deep
            legal know-how- all at a fraction of U.S. prices. Why overspend on
            the system, when you can outsmart it?
